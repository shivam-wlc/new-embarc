                I can confidently say that I couldn't have done it without you
                Judith. I remember our first video chat about 6 weeks ago - I
                thought it wouldn't be possible to submit all 3 on time but for
                some reason you believed in me :) I don't want to be too
                emotional, but one of your emails - "I GOT YOUR BACK.." - filled
                me with spirit and energy.

                Luke is not only knowledgeable about the admissions process,
                including the PAT exam and the interview style, but he is
                articulate and communicates well so he is effective. I was
                especially impressed by how perceptive he was at understanding
                my son’s weak areas and explaining the techniques and methods he
                should use to tackle the trickier problems. Going forward, I

                Oxbridge applications, if they needed it.

                essays that I wouldn't have worked on so much had I not had her
                guidance. I was successful in getting into all schools,
                including my top choice, UCLA.

                Jon - You gave me great advice on not only Dartmouth, the school
                you worked with, but also on NYU, which I’m more than happy to
                have received admission into. Thanks for always going out of
                your way to help me out whenever I’m in doubt about my
                applications. I couldn’t do this without you!
